				  render defines several layers from surface to high atmosphere representing the planet.
				  red, green, blue: color mixing from 0.00 (black) to 1.00 (white)
				  alpha: transparency factor from 0.00 (invisible) to 1.00 (opaque)
				  texture: optional texture to use, can come from resource pack, vanilla or the mod itself
				  periodU, periodV: optional texture rotation period over the planet, measured in seconds, defaults to 0 (disabled)
				  		Texture coordinates are defined along U and V axis (you can see them as X and Y axis in the context of the texture pixels).
				  		A periodU of 40 means the texture will do progressively shift along U axis, doing a full rotation in 40 seconds.
				  		A periodU of -80 means the texture will shift twice slower in the opposite direction. 
				  additive: optional blending function, defaults to false (multiplicative)
				  		Blending is the mathematical operation to mix existing pixel (previous layer or sky background) with the new one.
				  
				  In most cases, you want the first layer to be alpha="1.00", or the players will see the sky through the planet.
